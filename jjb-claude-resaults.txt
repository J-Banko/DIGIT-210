Prompt: Can you write me an obituary about a person who died in an unusual or comical way?


Responses:

1. Here is a draft obituary for someone who died in an unusual way:

John "Johnny Lightning" Watts, age 52, died Tuesday after being struck by lightning while sitting on the toilet during a thunderstorm. 

John was born on March 14, 1972 in Boise, Idaho. He was an avid storm chaser and amateur meteorologist who loved predicting the weather, especially during severe thunderstorms. John earned the nickname "Johnny Lightning" due to his penchant for seeking out electric storms to photograph and document. 

On Tuesday evening, John was at home when he noticed a large thunderstorm approaching. Disregarding warnings to seek shelter, John set up his camera equipment on the back porch to document the storm. However, shortly after sitting down on the toilet to wait for the storm, witnesses say a large lightning bolt struck John directly. He was declared dead on the scene. 

John is survived by his wife Jane and three children. A memorial service will be held on Friday at 2pm at the First Baptist Church in Boise. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made to the National Storm Chaser Foundation. The family asks that you refrain from making any "puns" about John's shocking demise, as he did genuinely love storm chasing.


2. Here is another draft obituary about someone who died in a peculiar way:

Beloved grandmother Betty Jones, age 79, passed away last Tuesday in a tragic yet comical baking accident. Betty was born in 1945 and was known for her delicious pies that she loved to bake for her family and friends. 

Last Tuesday morning, Betty was preparing to bake an apple pie and had laid out all the ingredients on the counter. As she went to grab some cinnamon, she accidentally slipped on a banana peel that her pet monkey Bananas had left on the floor. Poor Betty went flying into the air and landed face first into the pie tin, which was full of raw eggs and flour. She was knocked unconscious and suffocated in the mounds of raw pie ingredients. 

Betty is survived by her children Anna and Jack, grandchildren Lauren, Ava and Liam, and her mischievous monkey Bananas. A memorial service will be held on Saturday at 11am at Eastside Baptist Church. In lieu of flowers, the family asks that you consider making a donation to the Pie Lovers of America Foundation. Betty's family also asks that attendees refrain from making "egg on her face" jokes at her expense. She will be fondly remembered for her love of baked goods, even if they ultimately led to her quirky and untimely demise.


3. Here is my attempt at another humorous obituary:

Beloved prankster Hank Hill, age 43, passed away Tuesday in an elaborate homemade Rube Goldberg machine accident. 

Hank was born in 1980 and was known for his eccentric sense of humor and love of complex machines and gadgets. On Tuesday afternoon, Hank was found deceased amidst a tangled mess of pulleys, levers, and springs - the apparent victim of an overly complex contraption meant to automatically serve Hank a beer while he relaxed in his La-Z-Boy recliner. 

Investigators believe Hank was attempting to create a series of chain reactions that would result in a can of beer being lifted from a nearby cooler and transported across the room into Hank's waiting hand. However, a misaligned pulley sent the beer veering off course, setting off a cascading series of events that ultimately led to Hank being whacked in the forehead with the can of beer at high velocity. 

Hank is survived by his wife Sally and three kids - Lisa, Tyler, and Chester. Per Hank's wishes, his burial will take place in a custom-designed coffin resembling an oversized Pringles can. In lieu of flowers, please donate to the Rube Goldberg Machine Society in Hank's memory. The family also asks that you refrain from making any "dummkopf" jokes at Hank's expense. His passion for zany inventions may have led to his untimely end, but his creativity brought joy to many.
